#Contributing to No-FLoC

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

The [specification](https://github.com/WICG/floc) for Google's FLoC is unfinished. As a result, this document can get out of date. So any and all help is welcome!

There aren't any structured rules, just wanted to say thank you for the effort in making the internet a better place for everyone ðŸ™‚
